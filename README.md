# interactive-image-markers-AR

### Project description and features:  

- A simple Augmented Reality App in Vuforia within the Unity SDK;
- Detects multiple marker targets (content, plus, and minus);
- Overlays a 3D Character (cylinder) from Unity Asset Store on the content target marker;
- Uses Vuforia Smart Terrain to detect the markers in real-time; and
- Provides interactivity with the markers, scaling the size of the 3D Character based on the detected marker or the shorter distance from the content marker. E.g. the 3D object scales up when the _plus_ is closer than the _minus_ to the _content_ marker.
